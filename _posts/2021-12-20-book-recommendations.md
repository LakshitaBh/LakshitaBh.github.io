I thoroughly enjoy reading books. I've read books from various genres recently that I would absolutely rate 5-stars. Some of my recommendations in no particular order: 

1. Thank you, Jeeves by P.G. Wodehouse (Genre: Humorous Fiction)
2. The Dutch House by Ann Patchett (Genre: Fiction)
3. Educated by Tara Westover (Genre: Memoir)
5. Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi (Genre: Historical Fiction)
6. Eleanor Oliphant is completely fine by Gail Honeyman (Genre: Fiction)
7. Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders (Genre: Historical Fiction, Magical realism, experimental fiction)

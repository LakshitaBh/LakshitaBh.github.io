Hi there. My name is Lakshita Bhargava and I am a Platform Engineer at HSBC. I manage cloud infrastructure for applications on Google Cloud Platform with DevOps. Additionally, I have often been part of innovation and automations at HSBC.

I am also pursuing my interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. My goal is to elevate healthcare by leveraging ML. 

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, India in 2019. 

The reason for creating this blog is to share what I've been learning. 'Gyatso' is a tibetan name meaning **Ocean** denoting my vision of gaining vast and in-depth knowledge in variety of disciplines such as spirituality, mindfulness, literature, biology, AI and more.

Hi there. My name is Lakshita Bhargava, and I am a Computer Science graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Prior to this, I worked as a Platform Engineer at HSBC, where I managed cloud infrastructure for applications on the Google Cloud Platform, employing DevOps practices. During my time at HSBC, I was actively involved in innovation and automation initiatives.

I am also pursuing my interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. My goal is to elevate healthcare by leveraging ML. 

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, India, in 2019.

The reason for creating this blog is to share what I've been learning. 'Gyatso' is a tibetan name meaning **Ocean** denoting my vision of gaining vast and in-depth knowledge in variety of disciplines such as spirituality, mindfulness, literature, biology, AI and more.

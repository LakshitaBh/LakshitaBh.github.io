Hi there. My name is Lakshita Bhargava and I am a Platform Engineer at HSBC. I manage infrastructure for various application teams on Google Cloud Platform through Terraform and other DevOps tools. The goal of our team is to create reusable infrastructure code and automation. 

I've also been pursuing my interest in Machine Learning. My long term goal is to work at the intersection of Medicine and Machine Learning. 

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, India in 2019.

I thoroughly enjoy reading books. I've read books from various genres recently that I would absolutely rate 5-stars. Some of my recommendations in no particular order: 

1. <em>Thank you, Jeeves</em> by P.G. Wodehouse (Genre: Humorous Fiction)
2. <em>The Dutch House</em> by Ann Patchett (Genre: Fiction)
3. <em>Educated</em> by Tara Westover (Genre: Memoir)
5. <em>Homegoing</em> by Yaa Gyasi (Genre: Historical Fiction)
6. <em>Eleanor Oliphant is completely fine</em> by Gail Honeyman (Genre: Fiction)
7. <em>Lincoln in the Bardo</em> by George Saunders (Genre: Historical Fiction, Magical realism, experimental fiction) 
8. <em>The Book of Joy</em> by 14th Dalai Lama, Desmond Tutu, and Douglas Carlton Abrams (Genre: Self Help)
